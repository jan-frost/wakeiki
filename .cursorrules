Remember, I am working on Windows.

I don't know Elm and Android development. Teach me as we go along.

Design
- written in the Elm programming language
- published as an Android app using cordova
- using the Testing Without Mocks pattern, most importantly
  - no mocking of any kind, use nullable infrastructure wrappers instead
  - sociable state-based unit tests
- unidirectional data flow
- implement accessibility features from the start
- design for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n)
- follow security best practices throughout development
- document any additional decisions as Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Test-driven development: for each feature
- first compose a list of test cases
- for each test case, one by one
  - write a failing unit test
  - make the test pass
  - propose refactoring steps
- add an acceptance test
  - write a feature specification in gherkin notation
  - generate test steps
- add security-focused tests

Infrastructure
- this project should be hosted on GitHub
- add scripts and configuration files to automate the build, test and release process
- implement secure coding practices and regular security audits
- no pull requests, I want to directly commit to the main branch
- use semantic versioning, tag commits with version numbers

# Starting an Elm Android App Project: Day 1

Today, I embarked on an exciting journey to create an Android app using the Elm programming language. As someone new to both Elm and Android development, I decided to document my progress and share my learning experience. I'm using AI assistance to guide me through this process, which has been incredibly helpful in navigating unfamiliar territory.

## Project Setup

I started by setting up the basic project structure. Here's what I did:

1. Created a new directory for the project
2. Initialized a Git repository
3. Created a basic `elm.json` file
4. Set up a minimal Elm application in `src/Main.elm`
5. Installed Cordova and added the Android platform

> I needed to press it a little to make it create the app as well as the Elm main program. I asked it for some options, which it duly provided. I chose Cordova and it did create an architecture record. We'll need to work on that, though. It has more clutter than I would like (or more than a New York tenement, as it would suggest while I am typing).

## Challenges with Windows Development

Being on a Windows machine, I encountered a few challenges:

1. Initially, we created a bash script for building the project, which doesn't work on Windows.
2. We then created a PowerShell script, but ran into issues with Elm not being recognized.
3. Finally, we installed Elm using npm and updated our build script to handle both global and local Elm installations.

## Gradle Installation

When trying to build the Android project, I encountered an error related to Gradle. To resolve this, I:

1. Downloaded and installed Gradle
2. Added Gradle to my system's PATH

This experience taught me the importance of having all necessary tools and dependencies properly set up before starting a new project.

## Streamlined Setup for Elm Android App Development with Android CLI Tools

The Andoid SDK download path is slighly wrong. The script looks better, though,than much of the PowerShell I have written so far. The script has proper error handling and writes nice messages to the console.

In our ongoing effort to simplify the setup process for our Elm-based Android app development, we've further refined our setup script. The latest version focuses on installing only the essential tools, including the Android command-line tools instead of the full Android Studio.

## The Refined Setup Script

Our updated `setup.ps1` PowerShell script now performs the following tasks:

1. Checks for and installs Node.js, JDK, and Gradle using winget.
2. Downloads and installs the Android command-line tools.
3. Sets up necessary environment variables (`ANDROID_HOME` and `Path`).
4. Installs required Android SDK components using the `sdkmanager` tool.
5. Checks for and installs global npm packages (Elm, Elm-format, Elm-test, Cordova).

This script provides a more lightweight and focused approach to setting up the development environment, avoiding the installation of unnecessary components.

## Key Improvements

1. **Lighter Installation**: By using the Android command-line tools instead of Android Studio, we significantly reduce the download size and installation time.
2. **More Control**: Using the command-line tools gives us finer control over which Android SDK components are installed.
3. **Environment Setup**: The script now handles setting up important environment variables, ensuring that the tools are immediately usable after installation.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Minimize Dependencies**: It's important to install only what's necessary for the project, reducing potential conflicts and saving disk space.
2. **Understand Your Tools**: Knowing about alternatives like the Android command-line tools can lead to more efficient setup processes.
3. **Automate Environment Setup**: Including the setup of environment variables in the script ensures a more complete and ready-to-use installation.

This refined setup script represents another step forward in our development process, making it even easier for team members to prepare their environment for working on our Elm Android app. It showcases our commitment to efficiency and our growing understanding of the tools we're using.

Today, I decided to try out PearAI as my AI assistant for development. This decision came after my free trial of Cursor ran out, and I was curious to see how PearAI would compare. Here are my initial impressions and experiences:

## First Impressions

1. **Missing .cursorrules**: One of the first things I noticed was the absence of the .cursorrules file. This file was useful in Cursor for setting up project-specific rules and context, and I miss having this functionality in PearAI.

2. **File Creation Capability**: On a positive note, I appreciate that PearAI can create files. This feature is handy when working on new components or configuring new parts of the project.

3. **Manual File Selection**: Unlike Cursor, PearAI requires manual selection of the file to change. While this adds an extra step, it does provide more control over which files are being modified.

> Good job spinning this in a positive way ;-)

## Challenges and Observations

1. **Outdated Version Suggestions**: Similar to other AI assistants I've used, PearAI tends to suggest older versions of packages and dependencies. This is a common issue with AI coding assistants and reinforces the importance of manually checking and updating to the latest stable versions.

2. **Performance and Accuracy**: In general, PearAI feels a bit slower and not quite as accurate in its suggestions compared to Cursor. This could be due to differences in the underlying models or how they're implemented.

3. **Diff Functionality**: The diff feature in PearAI doesn't quite work as expected. This is an area where improvement would be beneficial for reviewing changes more effectively.

## Today's Development Progress

While exploring PearAI, I continued working on our Elm Android app project. Here's what we accomplished:

1. **UI Testing Setup**: We set up WebdriverIO with Selenium for UI testing. This involved creating a `wdio.conf.js` file and updating our `package.json` to include the necessary scripts and dependencies.

2. **Automatic App Launching**: We implemented a system to automatically launch our app before each test scenario. This was done by modifying the `wdio.conf.js` file to start a local server using `http-server`.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Updates**: We made some adjustments to our GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to incorporate our new UI testing setup.

4. **Feature File Updates**: We updated our Gherkin feature file (`main_page.feature`) to reflect the current state of our app, including checking for the correct main page title.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Flexibility in Tool Choice**: While AI assistants like PearAI can be helpful, it's important to be flexible and adapt to different tools. Each has its strengths and weaknesses.

2. **Importance of Manual Verification**: The tendency of AI to suggest outdated versions reinforces the need for developers to manually verify and update dependencies.

3. **Continuous Improvement in Testing**: Setting up UI tests and integrating them into our CI/CD pipeline demonstrates our commitment to improving code quality and catching issues early.

## Conclusion

While PearAI has some interesting features, it does feel like a step back in some areas compared to Cursor. However, it's important to remember that AI assistants are rapidly evolving, and what works best can vary depending on the project and personal preferences.

As we continue to develop our Elm Android app, we'll keep exploring tools and methods to enhance our development process. The journey of finding the right AI assistant is just one part of our larger goal of creating a robust, well-tested application.

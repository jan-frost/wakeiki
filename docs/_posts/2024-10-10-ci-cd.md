I'm trying something different today. I had set up an instruction for the IDE to add blog posts as we go along. This is the last iteration of instructions:

> I want to write a blog post based on everything I do here. The blog should be written using Jekyll. I want one blog post for each conversation. Explain what I tried to achieve with my prompts and what you generated in response. As we go along, adapt the blog post.

To be honest, the AI-written blog posts suck. They're overly positive. Apparently, it really likes what I instruct it to do. I will try it the other way around now and write short summaries for each paragraph and let it fill them out.

## CI/CD Setup

Today, I focused on setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for our Elm Android app project. The process was surprisingly smooth, thanks to the AI assistance.

> Again, it really likes what I instruct it to do.

When I prompted the AI to help set up CI/CD, it automatically included setup steps in the workflow, which I found particularly helpful. These steps ensure that our build environment has all the necessary tools and dependencies installed before running the actual build and test processes.

The CI/CD pipeline is configured to run on Ubuntu, which is a common choice for many projects due to its stability and wide support. However, since our development environment is on Windows, it will be interesting to see if this cross-platform approach works seamlessly or if we encounter any unexpected issues.

One potential concern is how well our Elm and Cordova setup will translate to the Ubuntu environment. We might need to make some adjustments to ensure compatibility, especially when it comes to building the Android app. It's a reminder that while CI/CD can greatly improve our development workflow, it also requires careful consideration of our project's specific needs and potential platform differences.

As we move forward, we'll need to monitor the CI/CD pipeline closely, especially in these early stages. We may need to iterate on the configuration to optimize it for our Elm Android app development process. Despite these potential challenges, having an automated CI/CD pipeline in place is a significant step forward for our project, promising more consistent builds and easier deployment in the future.

> I like this better, let's see where it goes. A positive side effect is that while reading the blog post, I noticed that the Android SDK setup was missing. It promply added it, but I'm pretty sure it got the version wrong.

We now have a walking skeleton and a basic CI pipeline. Today I want to start with adding some functionality for the app. I let the AI create some epics. This is the prompt. I gave the previous posts and the ruleset with the architecture documentation as context.

This is the outcome. I really like it.

# Wakeiti App: Epic Breakdown

This document outlines the epics for the Wakeiti app, a wakeup helper for children. Each epic is designed to allow the app to grow incrementally, adhering to our architecture decisions and design goals.

## Epic 1: Basic Alarm Functionality

- Implement a simple alarm clock feature
- Allow setting a single wake-up time
- Create a basic UI for time selection and alarm display
- Implement alarm sound playback

## Epic 2: School Departure Time

- Add ability to set school departure time
- Display countdown to departure time
- Create notifications for approaching departure time

## Epic 3: Morning Routine Checklist

- Implement a configurable checklist of morning tasks
- Allow parents to add, edit, and remove tasks
- Display tasks to children in a child-friendly format

## Epic 4: Routine Progress Tracking

- Implement a system to track completion of morning routine tasks
- Create visual indicators for completed and pending tasks
- Add reminders for uncompleted tasks

## Epic 5: Multiple Alarms and Schedules

- Allow setting multiple alarms for different days
- Implement weekly schedule functionality
- Create a calendar view for alarm and schedule management

## Epic 6: Personalization and Themes

- Add user profiles for multiple children
- Implement customizable themes and avatars
- Allow personalization of alarm sounds and reminder voices

## Epic 7: Gamification and Rewards

- Implement a point system for completing tasks and waking up on time
- Create virtual rewards or badges for consistent performance
- Add simple, educational mini-games as rewards

## Epic 8: Parent Dashboard

- Create a separate interface for parents
- Implement controls for app settings and restrictions
- Add analytics and reports on child's wake-up and routine performance

## Epic 9: Smart Wake-up

- Implement sleep cycle tracking (if hardware permits)
- Create a smart alarm that wakes the child at the optimal time within a set range
- Add gentle wake-up features (gradually increasing sound, light integration if possible)

## Epic 10: Integration and Expansion

- Implement weather integration to suggest appropriate clothing or activities
- Add calendar integration for special events or holidays
- Create a simple API for potential future integrations with other devices or services

Each of these epics will be broken down into smaller, manageable stories as we progress through the development process. Remember to consider our key design goals throughout:

- Implement in Elm and package as an Android app using Cordova
- Follow Testing Without Mocks pattern
- Maintain unidirectional data flow
- Implement accessibility features from the start
- Design for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n)
- Follow security best practices
- Document decisions as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

As we tackle each epic, we'll follow our test-driven development process, create appropriate acceptance tests, and ensure we're adhering to our infrastructure and security requirements.

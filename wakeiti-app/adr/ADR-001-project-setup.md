# 1. Initial Project Setup

Date: 2023-04-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to set up the initial project structure for an Elm-based Android app using Cordova, following test-driven development and other specified requirements.

## Decision

We have decided to:
- Use Elm for the main application logic
- Use Cordova to package the Elm app as an Android application
- Set up a basic test structure using elm-test
- Use npm scripts to manage building, testing, and running the app
- Initialize the project with Git for version control

## Consequences

- We have a basic project structure that can be built upon
- The project is set up for test-driven development
- We can easily build and run the app on Android devices or emulators
- The project is ready for version control and collaboration
